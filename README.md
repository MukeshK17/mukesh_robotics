# mukesh_robotics  

This repository is **for learning and practicing introductory robotics concepts**.  
It contains simulation models, launch files, and experiments built using **MuJoCo** and **ROS 2**.

## Current Model: Inverted Pendulum with Interaction  
The current model demonstrates an **inverted pendulum** mounted on a cart.  
- A **ball falls** under gravity.  
- The pendulum **swings and hits the ball**.  
- The ball then **collides with two blocks**, showcasing contact dynamics and sequential interactions.  

This setup helps in understanding:  
- Pendulum dynamics  
- Contact interactions in MuJoCo  
- Multi-body simulation with sequential events

## Goal  
The repository will be gradually extended with more robotics simulations for practice and exploration.
